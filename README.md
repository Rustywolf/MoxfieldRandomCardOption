This extension adds a "Random Card" button to the side of the Playtest mode on Moxfield to allow for easier testing of cards such as "Gonti, Lord of Luxury", "Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer" or "Etali, Primal Storm", which interact with opposing decks.

The button should be located under the existing "Add Token" button.
